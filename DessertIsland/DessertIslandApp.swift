/*
 
 Please read the following guidelines carefully before starting the coding challenge:

 Asynchronous code must be written using Swift Concurrency (async/await).
 
 Be sure to filter out any null or empty values from the API before displaying them.
 UI/UX design is not what youâ€™re being evaluated on, but the app should be user friendly and should take basic app design principles into
 account.
 
 Your project should compile using the latest version of Xcode.
